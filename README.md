### Problem Statement
Utility scale solar power plants are found all throughout New York state, due to significant promotion policies over the last decade. Utility scale solar can be made up of hundreds or even thousands of solar panels, each of which requires routine maintenance. Your team has been commissioned by the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority (NYSERDA), whose staff hope to better understand the lifespan remaining for existing utility-scale solar farms. Design a quality control system to track and mitigate solar panel failure.
