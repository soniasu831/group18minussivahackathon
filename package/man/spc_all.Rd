\title{Create an average SPC chart for the max power output for each day}
\usage{
spc_all(panel_id, variable, date)
}
\arguments{
\item{panel_id}{Character. Solar panel ID corresponding to measurements.}

\item{variable}{Numeric vector. Vector containing variable to be analyzed.}

\item{date}{Date or POSIXct. Corresponding to each measurement.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 of the average SPC chart.
}
\description{
This function calculates daily peak values for a specified variable (e.g. power output)
 across one or more panels, computes the daily mean, and control limits, 
 and produces an averages chart using ggplot2. It also prints a tibble that assesses 
 whether the data passes the eight SPC checks.
}
\details{
- Daily peaks are calculated for each panel, then averaged across panels.
- Control limits are calculated as the grand mean Â± 3 standard erros.
- Ribbon highlights the control limits, and daily means are shown as points and lines.

g1 <- spc_all(panel_id, variable, date)
