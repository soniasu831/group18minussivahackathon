\title{Create moving range SPC chart for a variable of interest}
\usage{
spc_moving_range(panel_data, panel_id, variable)
}
\arguments{
\item{panel_data}{a tibble, as outputted from add_efficiency()}

\item{panel_id}{character, the unique ID of the solar panel of interest}

\item{var}{character, variable of interest - "e" for efficiency, "p" for power output}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object of the moving range chart.
}
\description{
This function calculates the moving range (absolute difference between consecutive daily
 peak values) for a variable of interest and produces a moving range chart using ggplot2.
 It also prints a tibble that assesses whether the data passes the eight SPC checks.
}
\details{
- The moving range is computed as the absolute difference between consecutive daily peaks.
- The upper control limit is calculated as the mean moving range plus 3 standard errors.
- The lower control limit is always set to 0 for moving range charts.
- Labels indicate the mean, upper control limit, and lower limit.

\examples{
\dontrun{
g_mr <- spc_moving_range(panel_data, panel_id, variable)
print(g_mr)
